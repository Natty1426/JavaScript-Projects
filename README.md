# Dice Game

A simple two-player dice game where the player with the higher roll wins.

## Description

This is a web-based game where two players roll a die. The game automatically determines and displays the winner or declares a draw based on the outcome of the dice rolls. To play again, simply refresh the browser.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The game will automatically roll the dice for "Player 1" and "Player 2" and display the results.
3. The winner is announced at the top of the page.
4. To play another round, refresh the page.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** Structures the game with elements for the title, players, and dice images.
* **CSS:** Styles the game, providing a dark background, a large title, and a centered layout.
* **JavaScript:** Handles the game logic:
    * Generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 for the dice rolls.
    * Dynamically updates the dice images based on the random numbers.
    * Compares the two numbers to determine and display the winner or a draw.

## Files

* `index.html`: The main HTML file for the game's structure.
* `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game's appearance.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game's logic.
* `image/`: A directory containing the dice images (`dice1.png` to `dice6.png`).
