# 🎲 Dice Game

A simple and fun two-player dice game where the player with the higher roll wins.

## ✨ Description

This is a web-based game where two players roll a die. The game automatically determines and displays the winner or declares a draw based on the outcome of the dice rolls. To play another round, simply refresh the browser. It's a great little project for beginners to understand basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
2.  The dice will roll automatically, and the winner will be announced at the top of the page.
3.  To play another round, simply refresh the browser tab\!
